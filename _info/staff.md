  <b> Kevin Burk (TA) </b>
  <i> "My name is Kevin Burk. I'm a second-year grad student interested in security and cryptography. I'm bad at writing biographies, but like to talk about programming and baking, so if you'd like to know me better, just say hi during lab or at office hours!" </i>

  <b> Zhening (Sirius) Zhang (TA) </b>
  <i> "Hello Class! I am your TA Sirius. I am an international student from China. My Chinese name is 张哲宁, which is spelled as Zhening Zhang in English alphabet. If you want to pronounce my Chinese name correctly, try “Chening Chang”. But I prefer being called "Sirius". Why? Well it’s a hell of a cool name, Don’t you think?!!! ... “Are you Serious?” ... “Yes, I am (Sirius). ” ... Okay, enough about my name. I am a 2nd quarter CS PhD student interested in research related to 3D Computer Vision (specifically, SLAM and SFM systems), deep learning (CNN, RNN, RL, etc), and robotics. Currently I am working with Prof. Tobias Hollerer’s Four Eyes Lab. I also just started a project with Prof. Katie Byl and her Robotics Lab recently. So if you are interested in Computer Vision, Robotics, Deep Learning, and VR/AR, feel free to talk to me. I am actually in need of undergraduate students to help with my research. Before I came to UCSB, I spent a half year at Tesla’s Headquarter in Palo Alto as a Firmware R&D intern. I got my Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science & Engineering with a minor in Electrical Engineering from UC Davis, where I spent quite some time with leading a Formula E Racing Team and hanging out with IEEE club folks there. So my background is very close to our Computer Engineering major I would say. So now you know where my interests lie, if you want to get career advice or are interested with any of my past experience, again, feel free to ask me during Office Hours or Lab sections. Finally, C++ and Object Oriented Design are very important to master as a CS student. You are in the right class. So I wish you all to have a very successful quarter with Richert!!! He is really nice and actually cares about you folks." </i>

    <b>Chandler Forrest (Tutor) </b>
    <i> "Hello CS 32 students! My name is Chandler and I’m a fifth-year Computer Science major. I came to UCSB with the intention of majoring in Chemistry but I was lucky enough to switch into CS during the end of my second year and have loved it ever since! Two summers ago I did an internship at a remote company in downtown Santa Barbara slinging Java code and this previous summer I was doing research under Ben Hardekopf in the PLλab here on campus. I’m also one of the head coordinators for SB Hacks, UCSB’s yearly hackathon, and a product manager for UCSB’s campus app, GoGaucho. In my free time, I have taken up the hobby of collecting retro video games in a very `strategic` way. After this quarter, I am working as a full-time Software Engineer at Proofpoint in Sunnyvale, CA. If you have any questions about UCSB CS undergrad, getting involved on campus, or just general life advice, please feel free to email me at chan4est@gmail.com." </i>

    <i> "Hi everyone! My name is Eric Freilafert and I'm currently a senior finishing up my CS degree. Although some time has passed since I've taken this class, I still vividly remember learning all of the material that you're soon going to be learning. If you need any help (or just want to talk), please feel free to reach out to me during lab hours or during my office hours! I'm also open to discussing my experiences with other CS classes and my previous internships." </i>

  <b> Junayed Naushad (Tutor) </b>
  <i> "Hi! My name is Junayed Naushad and I am one of the undergraduate mentors for CS32. This is my first time tutoring/mentoring a course and I hope that throughout this quarter we can work together and learn as much about computer science as possible. I am a third year computer engineering student and my interests in the field range from low level hardware, like embedded systems, to machine learning and AI/automation. In my spare time I enjoy powerlifting and following my two favorite sports teams, the Los Angeles Lakers and FC Barcelona. Feel free to reach out to me on Piazza or during one of my office hours if you have any questions!" </i>
