* <b>NOTE:</b> Use these sample exams as additional practice and anticipation of what kind of questions may be asked on the midterm exam. <b>DO NOT</b> base your studying only on these exams. I expect all students to review the material thoroughly.

	- Given code, what is the output ...
	- Similar to midterm 1, expect it to take no more than ~ one hour (maybe sooner).
		- Will cover a broad range of topics, but probably not everything

Topics
	- Will cover everything up to last Wednesday's lecture (2/20)
	- Midterm 2 will be cummulative, but with a heavy emphasis on post-midterm 1 material.

Quadratic Sorting Algorithm
    - InsertionSort was not covered on Midterm 1, but may be covered in Midterm 2.

Hash Table Topics

		- open-address hashing / double-hashing / chained-hashing
		- map vs unordered_map
		- Implementation details

Mergesort / Quicksort

	- Know the runtime analysis (best / average / worst cases) and space requirements.

Testing
	- Understand main ideas
		- The tddFuncs way of testing
		- Unit testing
		- Test Driven Development (TDD)
		- Various cases of tests
			Normal / Error / Boundary

Inheritance
	- Understand concepts and how to implement them
	- How constructors / destructors of base / sub classes work
	- Understand memory concepts of base and sub class attributes / functions on the stack and the heap
		- Memory / Object slicing
	- Understand inheritance hierarchies and valid / accessible types

Polymorphism
	- What is polymorphism and when you may want to use it
	- How to enable polymorphism
	- Pure virtual functions and abstract classes
	- How it works in memory

Exceptions
	- Try / catch mechanisms
